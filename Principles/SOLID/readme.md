# SOLID PRINCIPLES

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP
These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper
"Design Principles and Design Patterns"
The intention of these principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier
to maintain and easier to extend.

## S - SINGLE RESPOSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

A class should be responsible for only one thing. If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled.
A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility. This principle applies not only to classes, but also to software components and microservices.
When designing our classes, we should aim to put related features together, so whenever they tend to change they change for the same reason. And we should try to separate features if they will change for different reasons.

## O - OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE

## L - LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE

## I - INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE

## D - DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE
